# Refactored code from Michael Gledhill's article, [A Master Detail example, using JSON & AngularJS](http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/837693/A-Master-Detail-example-using-JSON-AngularJS?msg=5167174#xx5167174xx)
The goal of this refactor was to encapsulate angularJS code into a directive for better HTML readability and easier code organization.
In other words, to learn how to create directives.

## The output looks like this.
